Malaria is a life-threatening mosquito-borne blood disease. It originates from the infected
Anopheles mosquito that transmits a parasite. This enters the victim’s blood system and into their liver
where the parasite reproduces. The ending result is the victim getting a high fever that entails shaking
chills and pain or in worst case scenarios, coma and death. With the rising epidemic of malaria, it has
been a concern within the health care industry on the parasite resistance to antimalaria drugs and the
clearance rates.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 3.2 billion people are at risk of
malaria which has made this mosquito-borne infection a critical public health problem. There was an
estimated 438,000 people that died from malaria in 2015 and 620,000 in 2017.

Resistance to anti-malarial drugs has led malaria researchers to investigate what covariates
(parasite and host factors) are associated with resistance. In this regard, investigation of how covariates
impact malaria parasites clearance is often performed using a two-stage approach in which the WWARN
Parasite Clearance Estimator or PCE is used to estimate parasite clearance rates and then the estimated
parasite clearance is regressed on the covariates. However, the recently developed Bayesian Clearance
Estimator instead leads to more accurate results for hierarchical regression modelling which motivated
the authors to implement the method as an R package, called “bhrcr”.
