Given malaria parasite clearance profiles of a set of patients, the “bhrcr” package performs Bayesian hierarchical regression to estimate malaria parasite clearance rates along with the effect of covariates on them in the presence of “lag” and “tail” phases. In particular, the model performs a linear regression of the log clearance rates on covariates (parasite and host factors) to estimate the effects within a Bayesian hierarchical framework. All posterior inferences are obtained by a “Markov Chain Monte Carlo” based sampling scheme which forms the core of the package.
